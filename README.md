# Simple Shell Project

## Description üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This is a basic implementation of a Unix shell in C, designed to meet specific project requirements. The shell provides a command-line interface that can execute system commands, handle environment variables, and support both interactive and non-interactive modes.

## Project Requirements ‚úÖ
The shell is implemented according to the specifications in `shell.h`, with the following key functions:
- `shell_interactive()`: Manage interactive shell mode
- `shell_no_interactive()`: Handle non-interactive command execution
- `read_line()`: Read input lines
- `parse_line()`: Tokenize input lines
- `exe_args()`: Execute parsed command arguments
- `print_env()`: Display environment variables
- Custom `getenv()` implementation
- Command path resolution with `is_a_command()`

## Supported Delimiters ‚å®Ô∏è
The shell uses the following token delimiters:
- Space ` `
- Tab `\t`
- Carriage return `\r`
- Newline `\n`
- Bell `\a`

## Prerequisites üñ•Ô∏èüíªüíæ
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- UNIX-like operating system (Linux, macOS)
- Standard C libraries

## Compilation üì∂
To compile the shell, use the following command:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o simple_shell
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
Run the shell and interact directly:
```bash
./simple_shell
simple_shell$ ls
simple_shell$ pwd
simple_shell$ exit
```

### Non-Interactive Mode ‚èπÔ∏è
Pipe commands or use input redirection:
```bash
echo "ls" | ./simple_shell
cat commands.txt | ./simple_shell
```

## Built-in Commands ü¶∫ü•Ω
- `exit`: Terminate the shell
- `env`: Print environment variables

## Key Functionality üîëüóùÔ∏è
- Dynamic command line reading
- Tokenization of input
- Path resolution for executable commands
- Process creation and execution
- Environment variable handling

## Limitations üõÇüõÉ 
- Limited built-in command support
- Basic path resolution
- No advanced shell features like pipes or redirections

## File Structure üóÇÔ∏èüóÉÔ∏è
- `shell.h`: Header file with function declarations
- `main.c`: Entry point and mode selection
- Implementation files for each core function

## Error Handling üÜò
Handles various error scenarios:
- Unknown commands
- Memory allocation failures
- Process creation errors
- Command execution errors
